I'm Jesenia Bernal Mogollon

About me 😜

I am currently refining my software development skills at Holberthon School, specializing in Python, JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and SQL.

Recently, I had the opportunity to develop a game called PongGame using Phaser and JavaScript, allowing me to apply my knowledge to a practical and exciting project.

Furthermore, I have experience in C programming, distinguished by the creation of projects such as Simple Shell and printf. I am also proficient in the use of GitHub and ready to embark on a rewarding career as a developer.

Additionally, I hold a degree in Financial Management with skills in data analysis and customer service.

😁 I'm excited to contribute and collaborate on challenging projects that drive innovation and technological progress. I'm always ready to learn and grow in this exciting world of technology! 😃
